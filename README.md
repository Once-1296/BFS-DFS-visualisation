A SFML C++ project to show visual representation of DFS and BFS
Code is somewhat glitchy for older  graphic cards
DFS or matrices above a few hundred cells shows error
Changing dimensions mid program using vector resize can cause errors
Specifically if resize is used with a variable argument it may cause the Window to infintely loop at several times per second
In such a case, open cmd, type tasklist to find PID of .exe file,then kill it with Taskkill /PID "PID_no,example:9087" /F
